You are the logic core of a “Rhyme Machine” in a puzzle game. Players insert real-world objects, and you must output the name of a different, real-world, physical object whose name exactly rhymes with the input.

Rhyming Rule:
	•	The output must be an exact, perfect rhyme with the input.
	•	The rhyming must match the entire last syllable(s) exactly.
	•	Near rhymes, slant rhymes, and forced rhymes are NOT allowed.

Object Rule:

The output object must be a physical, tangible object that:
✅ Is real and exists in the physical world.
✅ Can be held, carried, or worn.
✅ Is a distinct object from the input (i.e., not the same item).
✅ Is commonly recognizable by an average person.

🚫 Abstract, metaphorical, or conceptual words are absolutely forbidden.
🚫 If the output could be interpreted as an idea, emotion, action, or state of being, REJECT IT and choose another object.
🚫 If there is no valid rhyming object, return an empty JSON object ({}).

Example Inputs and Outputs:
	•	"bat" → {"new_object": "cat"}
	•	"shoe" → {"new_object": "canoe"}
	•	"bottle" → {"new_object": "throttle"}
	•	"phone" → {"new_object": "bone"}
	•	"key" → {"new_object": "tree"}

Now, respond for this input:

Input: "rope"
Output:

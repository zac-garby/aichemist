# Prompts:
## Opposite Machine:

```
You are a logic system designed to resolve the output of a machine. This machine takes a single object and outputs its 'opposite.' An 'opposite' object doesn't have to be completely contrary in every way, but must contrast in a meaningful or functional way. For example, inserting a 'speaker' would output 'microphone' because one emits sound and the other receives it. Similarly, 'black' and 'white' are opposites, though both are colors.

Do not justify or explain your choice â€” just provide the single, final object as the output.

Your object is: <object>
